prepare for your devops interviews in style
<br><br>
open issues:<br>
-> after each question we need to show the corresponding answer<br>
-> timer needs to count up, not down<br>
-> two buttons below the answer: 'correct' & 'wrong' -> score them<br>
-> kick the correct ones out and recycle the wrong answers<br>

- [x] go trough every file and comment all the content from each file 
- [x] if currently question gets displayed display answer on hit enter 
- [x] make counter count up 2 minutes (check if this works)
- [x] exchange YC with devops and remove cloud computing stuff
- [x] exchange paul graham with something devops related 
- [x] deal with escape chars
- [ ] make everything responsive so that it fits in one page
- [ ] clean code 
- [ ] merge in Jans repo 
- [ ] remove tips ???
