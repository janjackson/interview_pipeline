prepare for your devops interviews in style
<br>
open issues:<br>
-> after each question we need to show the corresponding answer<br>
-> timer needs to count up, not down<br>
-> two buttons below the answer: 'correct' & 'wrong' -> score them<br>
-> kick the correct ones out and recycle the wrong answers<br>
